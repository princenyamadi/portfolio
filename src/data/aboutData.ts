  intro: `Hey there! I'm Prince, a passionate full-stack developer who believes that great code 
          is like poetry—elegant, purposeful, and impactful. My journey in tech started with 
          curiosity and has evolved into a mission to create digital experiences that make a 
          real difference in people's lives.`,

  story: `What started as late-night coding sessions in college has blossomed into a career 
          I'm genuinely excited about every single day. I've had the privilege of working 
          with startups that became success stories, enterprise companies solving complex 
          challenges, and everything in between. Each project taught me something new, 
          and I bring that collective wisdom to every line of code I write.`,

  philosophy: `I believe technology should be human-centered, accessible, and beautiful. 
               Whether I'm architecting a complex microservices system or crafting a pixel-perfect 
               UI component, I'm always thinking about the person on the other side of the screen. 
               Great software isn't just about clean code—it's about solving real problems elegantly.`,
